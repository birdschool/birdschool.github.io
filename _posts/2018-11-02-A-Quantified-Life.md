## “Instead of interrogating their inner worlds through talking and writing, they are using numbers. They are constructing a       quantified self.”
  We are living in the era that some have dubbed "the information age." It is becoming increasingly difficult to live under the radar in the modern world. We leave digital bread crumbs wherever we go, our credit card purchases, our search histories, our conversations, our location, and they are all being tracked and recorded by our personal computing devices. This data is then accessed (and in some cases sold) to different companies in order to target ads and sell to more specified demographics. 
  But what happens when we take control of our data? People love knowing and sharing about themselves. And Silicon Valley has taken notice. Now software developers are creating platforms through which we personally track, view, and share the statistics of our lives. Programs like Fitbit, productivity trackers, and the new iOS update that displays users total screentime on their devices, have all gained massive popularity. Using numbers to illuminate aspects of the world is not a new phenomenon. Certain fields like sociology, anthropology, or civil engineering have always used raw data to understand human nature and behavior in deeper terms. But now this power has been given to the individual, proposing a thorough understanding of the self. Numbers can illuminate hidden parts of our world, but numbers do not contain the full story. As Gary Wolfe writes, "For many self trackers, the goal is unknown." We may be able to aggregate our behavior, but to what end? An obsession with productivity, and an ammelioration of the self, often leads to abstract objectives to "be better" or "more efficient." 
    Information designers Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec aimed to change this. Their project Dear Data, focused on self tracking, but through their own unique method. They each tracked a certain aspect of their lives for one week, created a visual representation of the data on the back of postcard, and exchanged tidbits of their lives through the mail over the course of a year. This project stands out from other self tracking fads because it brings us right back to the analog, corporeal and emotional aspects of our lives shared physically, bringing people together outside of our digital lives. It bridges the gap between the traditional journaling of thoughts through words, and the collection of data quantified. Posavec and Lupi's project should be praised as a new way of thinking about ourselves in this "information age" as both quantified and complex, to be understood through words and numbers, collectively.
