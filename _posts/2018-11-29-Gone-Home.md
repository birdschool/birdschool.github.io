    Games and the act of play are naturally engrained into the human psyche. We are meant to play, and we have been doing so for thousands of years. Only in the last few decades, however, have games entered the digital sphere, rapidly growing and expanding in tandem with the advancement of techonology in the home. Videogames are a wildy popular cultural phenomenon. Competetive markets supply all different kinds of home consoles and games, and computer gaming through streaming or services like Steam have ubiquitized gaming in our lives. Many indie games are pioneering the path toward a different way of thinking about games and game culture, separate from the massive hoards of first person shooting platforms. 
    I recently completed the videogame Gone Home, created by the Fullbright Company. The game's mechanics are profoundly different than what most would consider a true videogame. It is set in the year 1995 and the player occupies the role of a young woman returning home after living away. She finds that her entire family has gone missing, and through limited interaction the player must piece together what has happened by finding certain artifacts, letters and notes scattered throughout the house. Gone Home directly challengers what it means to be a videogame. In many ways, this game occupies a space somewhere between game and literature. Its main objective is rooted in story, and much of the entertainment factor comes from the player's ability to piece this story together. For this reason one may question why they had made this story into a game at all. But it is the interactivity that each player is given, and the different stories that they each uncover through their divergent paths, that makes the story captivating, unique, and important for the progress of gaming as a whole. Indie games such as Gone Home challenge players to think of what a game really is and what it can be, and it opens the doors to the world of gaming to people with different backgrounds and interests.
