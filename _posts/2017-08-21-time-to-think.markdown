  Upon opening the link to Jon Bois serialized speculative fiction story, [17776](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football/), it appears as though your browser has been infected with a computer virus. But don’t be alarmed! It is the work of Bois’ multimedia narrative style that immediately pulls you in to an altered future reality recounted by sentient space probes, peering back at a distorted earth, thousands of years in the future. People have stopped aging, and thanks to microscopic devices called “nanos,” any threat to physical health has been eradicated. Humanity’s boredom and inevitable lack of progress or purpose has led to an evolved form of American Football in which games are played over thousands of years and thousands of miles. 
	
The content of this story is a stunning commentary, but it is the frame through which the story is told that is most fascinating. It belongs to an electronic genre known as Hypertext Fiction which utilizes links, videos, gifs, and other digital forms to heighten reader interaction through non-linear story telling. Before the internet, non linear story telling was employed in print fiction as well. Renowned novels such as James Joyce’s Ulysses, and even prevalent young adult fiction series like Choose Your Own Adventure books used non-linear techniques with different possible paths. In the age of digital media, we all encounter stories through screens several times a day. The surprising part of this is that works continue to resemble the written media of the past. As Jon Bois puts it, [“We’ve got to start thinking of the internet as something more than a glow in the dark newspaper.”](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/7/24/16003968/17776-questions-and-answers) Bois, however, was not the first to implement multi media expression through digital writing. Stories like the full online novel, [Sunshine 69](http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/1995-96/95-175.html),by Bobby Rabid, or the more recently popular [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/), a series of webcomics by Andrew Hussie, also use these approaches. 
	
  “In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If 	ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be non-ergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no extranoematic responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.” [Cybertext: Perspectives on Egodic Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_literature) by Espen J. Aarseth, electronic literature and video game scholar. 

  Our digital days are filled with endless scrolling. The ways in which written language is presented online is unengaging and arbitrary. Stories like 17776 are a challenge to the reader merely in the way it is presented, forcing the reader either to give up or dive in, encouraging full participation in the material. This is what ergodic literature signifies. Other forms of digital writing can take a thing or two from Hypertext fiction, and work away from the stale graveyard of click bait headlines, and progress toward an engaging and creative digital landscape.
