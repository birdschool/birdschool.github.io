## The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling
Humans, for whatever reason, have this intense and insatiable desire to know, to find the Truth and hold it close. We wish to anchor our psyche’s to the physical world, to shout “this is real, I am real!” And yet time, and time, and time again we discover that this search for absolute truth is futile. Each of us lives within [our own context of understanding](https://curiosity.com/topics/wittgensteins-beetle-in-a-box-says-youll-never-know-what-its-like-to-be-someone-else-curiosity/), and although the scientific method can bring our collective higher consciousness together towards the truth, we will never be able to cross the barrier of our minds, touch the truth and proclaim that this is true for me and you and everywhere across the universe. 

[Ted Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang), distinguished creative author, speaks to this in his short story “The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling.” It follows two characters living in different eras, and their encounters with technology as a tool for finding something real. In the somewhat near future, the narrator is researching a popular new device called Remem. Remem’s purpose is to record every single moment in the user’s life and its algorithms are able to sift through the users entire video database and pull up any memory that is called. It is essentially an external memory device that is constantly documenting video “proof” of one’s life. It is about as thorough as a truth collector can be. But is it? Chiang’s story allows us to think about several profound questions. Are photos and videos always accurate if they cannot truly capture the way that we feel in certain moments? Can one’s life really be condensed merely to 1’s and 0’s, and in what way is our natural process of selective memory useful in the creation of our own identities? We know that smell, mood, and tactile touch are crucial components of certain memories. If this was replaced by flat, unprocessed video recording, how would that change the way we understand our selves and the world?

On the flip side, the story also follows the life of Jijingi, a young boy living several centuries in the past. His story explores the introduction of another impactful technology, writing.  A European monk travels to his village and teaches him the power of the written word, how it changes the way we formulate thoughts, and record truth. But just because something is recorded does not make it fact. As Jijingi says,  “Our language has two words
for what in your language is called ‘true.’ There is what’s right, mimi, and what’s precise,
vough.” Remem simply records what is precise, but there is a discrepancy between what we feel to be right, and what has actually occurred. 

Technology cannot be relied upon to solve this issue. Whether is be recorded memory through video or through the written word, differing perspectives will always come to slightly different conclusions. These tools can be used to help bring us to a place of mutual understanding of our divergent viewpoints, but it cannot be relied upon to bring us into each others contexts. Until we are able to fully emerge ourselves into the mind of another, we will simply have to keep poking and prodding and reaching, getting as close as we can to some kind of collective interpretation of reality.
